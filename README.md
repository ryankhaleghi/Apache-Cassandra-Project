# Apache-Cassandra-Project
This database was created for a fictional startup, Sparkify, to analyze user activity and song data in order to help understand what users are listening to.

The data is contained in CSV files for the streaming event data. Using a Python API, I created a Apache Cassandra database and ETL process to take data from those CSV files, process it into tables in the Cassandra database, and test it against queries from the Sparkify analytics team.

This Cassandra database uses tables set up for each individual query.
